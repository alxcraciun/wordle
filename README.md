# Project Wordle

This project is a clone of the web-based game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), owned and published by The New York Times. 

As opposed to the original game, our database of words is included in [cuvinte_wordle.txt](cuvinte_wordle.txt) and we have an unlimited number of guesses.

In [wordle.py](wordle.py) you can play the game (the buggy behaviour one) and guess the word. Btw, you have an unlimited number of guesses :D

With [solver.py](solver.py), you can see how the computer takes "the best" approach to guess any word from the database.
